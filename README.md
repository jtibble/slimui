##SlimUI Framework

Thank you for trying out the SlimUI framework. 

Some of the project goals:
- Simplify the process of developing web applications
- Abstract-away the web technology stack
- Allow developers of all skill levels to add and modify application-specific functionality in a framework-agnostic way


##Sample Application
A sample application is included with this repository. To try it out, follow these steps:

1. Install NodeJS, NPM, and Bower, and run 'bower install' in the project root. This will fetch all of SlimUI's dependencies.
2. Host the /sample-application.html file, and open it up in a web browser. More documentation is provided in the sample application.
