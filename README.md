##SlimUI Framework

Thank you for trying out the SlimUI framework. 

Some of the project goals:
- Simplify the process of developing web applications
- Abstract-away the web technology stack
- Allow developers of all skill levels to add and modify application-specific functionality in a framework-agnostic way


##Sample Application
A sample application is included with this repository. To try it out, follow these steps:

1. Install NodeJS (and Node Package Manager, NPM) on your machine
2. Using NPM, install the NPM package and Gulp build-dependencies by running 'npm install'
3. Build the sample application by running 'gulp'
4. Using NPM, install Bower, and run 'bower install' in the project root. This will fetch all of SlimUI's runtime dependencies, like AngularJS
5. Host this folder, and open sample_application.html in a browser. More documentation is provided in the sample application
